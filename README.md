# CountDowner
_An old project used for learning and playing around github_

A simple count down progress bar. Set the time, watch the progress bar progress and then flash when time is up. You can have it e.g. at the bottom of screen telling you how long it is until lunch time or next meeting. Or have it running to see how many math calculations you can do in the given time.

Time is measured in minutes. The bar shows the remaining time. The last minute count down is show in seconds in red font and "sec".

Click to set the time to where you clicked - relative to time scale.

Right click for settings and more
- "Exit" and close the timer
- "Pause" to pause the timer: bar shows "P" and the remaining time. Select "Pause" again to resume
- change time scale (how long is the full timer bar): change the slider and then click "Set new times"
- "Fix bar" so it is just the bar at a fixed place on the screen and not the whole window. "Resize bar" to make it movable and resizable again.
